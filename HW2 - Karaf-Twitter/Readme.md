Write a client application that utilizes an Apache Camel / Apache Karaf Container framework and implements the Twitter REST API: http://twitsandbox.com/? (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.lang=en (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

Implement at least 8 of the APIs, and DO NOT use any code that you find online. No copy/pasting. You can use libraries for http requests (e.g. java.net.HttpURLConnection or Apache's HttpClient), and libraries that parse/generate xml or json. (e.g. XPath, DOM, JAXB, etc..), but otherwise your code must be original.

The twitter documentation is here:

https (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.:// (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

The example code in the Twitter Websocket Blueprint Example may be helpful.

NOTES:

Include in the source code comments, i.e. who wrote which code.
The Client should have a UI (Web/Javascript, AngularJS, etc.. or Java GUI, .NET, etc..)
Code should include Unit tests for all significant methods (e.g. jUnit, TestNG, unittest, etc..)
Code should be Submitted via class github repository: https://github.com/sjsu-cmpe272 (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. (team leaders send me your github ID for invite)
